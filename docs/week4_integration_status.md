# Week 4 Integration Status Report

## Date: 2025-07-19

## Phase 1: Integration Problem Solving ✅ COMPLETED

### 1.1 ML Service HTTP API Fix ✅
- Fixed port mapping issue (8002:8082)
- ML Service HTTP API is now accessible
- Health check endpoint working: `/api/v1/health`
- NLP processing endpoint working: `/api/v1/process`

### 1.2 Neo4j Initial Data Seeding ✅
- Created seed script with 10 companies, 10 executives, 30 news articles
- Successfully seeded Neo4j with initial data
- Graph statistics confirmed: 50 nodes, 50 relationships

### 1.3 Kafka Connection Status ✅
- All Kafka topics created: `raw-news`, `enriched-news`
- Consumer groups registered: `ml-service`, `graph-service-group`
- No consumer lag detected

## Phase 2: End-to-End Data Flow Verification 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### 2.1 News Crawling → Kafka → ML Service ✅
- ML Service successfully consumes from `raw-news` topic
- NLP processing working (entities, sentiment, keywords, risk analysis)
- Successfully produces enriched messages to `enriched-news` topic

### 2.2 ML Service → Kafka → Graph Service 🔄
- Graph Service consuming from `enriched-news` topic
- Consumer group showing no lag
- Neo4j storage integration needs verification

### 2.3 Graph Service → API Gateway → UI ❌
- API Gateway GraphQL working with mock data
- Graph Service GraphQL queries returning empty results
- Web UI has module loading errors

## Current Issues

1. **Graph Service Entity Cache**: Not loading companies from Neo4j
2. **Web UI**: Module not found errors preventing startup
3. **End-to-end Flow**: Data flow works but entities not queryable via GraphQL

## Test Results

### Services Health Status:
- ✅ Data Service: Healthy
- ✅ ML Service: Healthy (Kafka showing as disconnected in health check but actually working)
- ✅ Graph Service: Running (Neo4j connection issues in health check)
- ✅ API Gateway: Healthy
- ❌ Web UI: Not working due to module errors

### Kafka Message Flow:
- ✅ Manual message sent to `raw-news`
- ✅ ML Service processed and enriched the message
- ✅ Graph Service consumed the enriched message
- ❌ Data not queryable via GraphQL

## Next Steps

1. Fix Graph Service entity cache to load Neo4j data
2. Debug Web UI module loading issues
3. Complete integration testing
4. Move to Phase 3: Performance optimization

## Commands for Testing

```bash
# Check service health
curl http://localhost:8001/health
curl http://localhost:8002/api/v1/health
curl http://localhost:8003/health
curl http://localhost:8004/health

# Test ML Service
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/api/v1/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "삼성전자가 새로운 공장을 건설합니다"}'

# Test GraphQL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8004/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ companies(first: 5) { edges { node { id name riskScore } } } }"}'

# Send test message to Kafka
python scripts/test_e2e_flow.py
